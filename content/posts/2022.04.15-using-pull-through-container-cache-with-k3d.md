In my daily role I am a software engineer at Union focusing on backend development. We are the core maintainers, and the most frequent contributors, to the open-source [Flyte project](https://github.com/flyteorg/flyte). Per our [documentation](https://docs.flyte.org/en/latest/) it is described as "The Workflow Automation Platform for Complex, Mission-Critical Data and Machine Learning Processes at Scale". Basically, it is a framework to abstract execution of complex data workflows and the coinciding cloud infrastructure management. This enables teams to efficiently and effectively scale data processing.

# Using k3d For Local Development / Testing
Being a cloud-native application, Flyte currently requires a k8s cluster for executing individual workflow tasks and therefore, the core components are typically deployed in k8s. While this is a battle-proven production solution, it can be cumbersome for local development, where testing implementation changes must be (1) compiled into a docker image, (2) pushed to a remote docker registry, and (3) deployed to the k8s cluster. Thankfully, this is a common problem and there are well designed solutions.

[k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.4.1/) is a tool which constructs and manages localized k8s development environments. I can not overstate how useful this is for my development cycle. It uses docker to spawn individual k3s containers to provide lightweight k8s servers and agents. Additionally, it handles all of the internal networking including k8s port forwarding, volume mounts, etc.

Using this we can quickly stand up and tear down k8s testing clusters locally. An example command which I frequently use to create a testing cluster is provided below:

```bash
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ k3d cluster create -p "30081:30081@server:0" -p "30084:30084@server:0" -p "30087:30087@server:0" --image rancher/k3s:v1.21.8-k3s2 -v /dev/mapper/nvme0n1p3_crypt:/dev/mapper/nvme0n1p3_crypt flyte

```

Similarly, we can delete the cluster using the command below:

INFO[0000] Deleting cluster 'flyte'
INFO[0001] Deleting 2 attached volumes...

# Hosting Private Repositories with the Docker Registry Image
The Flyte system architecture is designed on microservices, which provide improved development speeds and scalability compared to a monolithic design. However, this does mean that we are forced to download a variety of container images every time we initialize Flyte deployment. In total, these may be on the order of 100s of MB which for some Internet connections is asking a lot. Unfortunately there does not seem to be a way to reuse local docker images within a k3d deployment. In my understanding this has to do with image format incompatibility.

Fortunately docker provides an image to host private repositories, namely the `registery:2` [image on dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/_/registry/). This image enables us to start a fully-compatible docker registry locally.

For our use-case we being by creating a docker volume to use as persistent storage. We could have alternatively used a local filesystem path as well.

```bash
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ docker volume create registry-flyte
registry-flyte
```

Then we run the image using the `REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL` environment variable to use this container as a remote proxy to the specified URL.

```bash
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ docker run -d --publish target=5000,published=127.0.0.1:5000 --name registry-flyte.local --env REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL=http://cr.flyte.org --volume registry-flyte:/var/lib/registry registry:2
6fd4dee8702ec82f4eb70086d460d73df87999d50bd09f1158a61a4183aa4977
```

Now we have a local docker registry serving on the address `127.0.0.1:5000` which proxies to `http://cr.flyte.org` and stores images in the docker volume `registry-flyte`.

# Enable the Pull-Through Registry Within k3d
To setup k3d to use our local docker registry proxy as a pull-through cache we need to inform k3d about which images should use the registry. This configuration requires a single yaml file, in our case `registries.yaml`. The syntax defines a mirror for the 'cr.flyte.org" repository to redirect to the endpoint of our local registry. There is ample documentation about [using private / local registries within k3d](https://k3d.io/v5.0.0/usage/registries/) and specifically on the [syntax of the configuration file](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/). An example is provided below:

```yaml
mirrors:
  "cr.flyte.org":
    endpoint:
      - "http://registry-flyte.local:5000"
```

Then we can modify our k3d cluster creation command to include the registry config with the `--registry-config` flag.

```bash
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ k3d cluster create -p "30081:30081@server:0" -p "30084:30084@server:0" -p "30087:30087@server:0" --image rancher/k3s:v1.21.8-k3s2 -v /dev/mapper/nvme0n1p3_crypt:/dev/mapper/nvme0n1p3_crypt --registry-config ~/documents/union/registries.yaml flyte

INFO[0014] Cluster 'flyte' created successfully!
INFO[0014] You can now use it like this:
kubectl cluster-info
```

And finally, we need to ensure that the local docker registry image is accessible through the k3d network by manually connecting it.

```bash
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ docker network connect k3d-flyte registry-flyte.local
```

Now we have a k3d cluster that will use our local docker registry and a pull-through cache for images from cr.flyte.org!

# Testing
To test this setup we can easily run a recent flytepropller image (just opening a shell which we will exit from immediately). This requires k3d to pull the remote image locally.

```bash
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ kubectl run -it --rm --image cr.flyte.org/flyteorg/flytepropeller:v0.16.44 test-docker-cache sh
If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.
/ $ exit
Session ended, resume using 'kubectl attach test-docker-cache -c test-docker-cache -i -t' command when the pod is running
pod "test-docker-cache" deleted
```

Using the registry REST API we first check the catalog contains the flyteorg/flytepropeller image and then validate the tags listed.

```bash
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000/v2/_catalog
{"repositories":["flyteorg/flytepropeller"]}
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ curl 127.0.0.1:5000/v2/flyteorg/flytepropeller/tags/list
{"name":"flyteorg/flytepropeller","tags":[..., "v0.16.43","99acef135bf44fdce8dcb6351c128628fcea0ed8","v0.16.44","eef8c265f4859f6dc0a0b745ac0339f5d2cbb1eb","v0.16.45","157cb56dd5c9faf0978f12bae3535a5636645789","v0.16.46","latest","d3bef3c3c01127b9321e075ae84c2b27d598cd8a","v0.16.47"]}
```

If that is not enough we can check the sizes of all docker volumes to ensure that our registry-flyte volume has data, specifically the aforementioned image.

``` bash
hamersaw@ragnarok:~$ docker system df -v

Now when we deploy Flyte all our images from `cr.flyte.org` are locally cached in the `registry-flyte` docker volume. Similarly, you can easily add additional pull-through registries for docker.io, query.io, etc by standing up a docker container with the correct proxy URL, adding the registry to the k3d registries configuration, and connection the docker image to the k3d network.
