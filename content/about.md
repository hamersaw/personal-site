PSA: Soon I will be strongly vested in gainful entry to the industrial job market. If my work interests you, [here is my resume](/resume.pdf). Please feel free to contact me. I would enjoy discussing future directions for my work and how they may fit your needs.

That being said ...

My name is Dan Rammer. I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Colorado State University focusing on distributed storage and analytics of spatiotemporal data at scale. I have also worked with large-scale Internet measurements to detect Internet outages and routing anomolies. 

Throughout my early schooling I concentrated significantly on athletics, procuring accolades in Football and Track & Field. I had the opportunity to compete collegiately at the University of Wisconsin, Oshkosh (Go Titans!) with varying levels of success. Though I grievously admit my best performances are behind me, I find exercise and fitness to offer a satisfying change of pace. 

Growing up in Wisconsin, I had the pleasure of being shaped by weekends camping, hunting, and fishing in the Northwoods. As such, I've learned to appreciate the solice of solitude provided by nature. Since beginning graduate school I've taken up backpacking, spending my free time hunting and exploring remoteness in the Colorado Rockies.
