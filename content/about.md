PSA: I will soon be graduating and strongly vested in the job market. If my work interests you please feel free to contact me. I would enjoy discussing future directions for my work and how they may fit your needs.

My name is Dan Rammer. I'm a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Colorado State University focusing on distributed storage and analytics of spatiotemporal data at scale. I have also worked with large-scale Internet measurements to detect Internet outages and routing anomalies.

Athletics have always been important to me. I can attribute much of my work ethic to the unrelenting pursuit of accolades in Football and Track & Field during my formative years. Through my success, I had the opportunity to compete collegiately in both Cross Country and Track & Field (Go Titans!). Though I grievously admit my best performances are behind me, I find exercise and general fitness to offer a satisfying change of pace.

Growing up in Wisconsin, I had the pleasure of being shaped by weekends camping, hunting, and fishing in the Northwoods. As such, I've learned to appreciate the solace of solitude provided by nature. Since beginning graduate school I've taken up backpacking, spending my free time pursuing seclusion in the Colorado Rockies.
