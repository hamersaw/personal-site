I'm a Ph.D. student at Colorado State University. My work on distributed systems, specifically harnessing spatiotemporal data characteristics to improve storage and analytics at scale provides significant reductions in resource utilization -- measureable in orders of magnitude. Additionally, I have experience in network security, focusing primarily on large scale Internet measurements by developing monitoring systems which scale globally.

I've always been interested in building things -- working with my hands from an early age. I began my career in a small, fast-paced data warehouseing company, enabling me to apply those skills to software engineering. This experience introduced me to large-scale data management and led me to consider graduate school. I have been developing my technical skills by working on the forefront of these efforts ever since.

As part of my current role, I'm included on a multiple University effort to build user-facing tooling for end-to-end understanding of urban sustainability data. Primarly involved in the backend, I have significantly reduced spatial query times by load-balancing distributed storage and analytics. Additionally, this experience has familiarized me with industry standards for software engineering and team orchestration. And I'm really enjoying it.

Moving forward, I'm excited about developing and deploying novel solutions to combat inefficiencies at scale.
