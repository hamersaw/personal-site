I'm a Ph.D. student at Colorado State University. My work on distributed systems general encompasses harnessing spatiotemporal data characteristics to improve storage and analytics at scale -- with reductions in resource utilization measureable in orders of magnitude. Additionally, I have experience in network security, focusing primarily on large scale Internet measurements to detect global routing anomolies and Internet outages.

TODO

Moving forward, I'm excited about developing and deploying novel solutions to combat inefficiencies at scale.
