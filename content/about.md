I am currently a Software Engineer at [Union.ai](https://union.ai). My role involves backend development on [Flyte](https://flyte.org), a cloud-native "... workflow automation platform for complex, mission-critical data and machine learning processes at scale". Specifically, I work with the OSS community to more effectively schedule data processing; reducing system overhead and scaling the platform to handle larger workflow quantities and sizes.

I recently completed my Ph.D. at Colorado State University. My work on distributed systems encompassed harnessing spatiotemporal data characteristics to improve storage and analytics at scale -- with reductions in resource utilization measureable in orders of magnitude. Additionally, I have experience in network security, focusing primarily on large scale Internet measurements to detect global routing anomolies and Internet outages.

Moving forward, I am excited about developing novel solutions to combat inefficiencies in data processing at scale.
